# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: UV (dependency management)
**Storage**: In-memory (strictly no database/files in Phase I)
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Console
**Project Type**: Python Console App
**Performance Goals**: N/A (Phase I)
**Constraints**: Single-user, synchronous execution
**Scale/Scope**: Phase I Proof-of-Concept

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] Clean Code: Is the design minimal and readable?
- [ ] Separation of Concerns: Is business logic isolated from console I/O?
- [ ] Single Responsibility: Does each module have one purpose?
- [ ] Predictable Behavior: Are side effects avoided?
- [ ] Reliable Input Handling: Are error paths defined for invalid user input?
- [ ] Architecture: Is storage strictly in-memory?
- [ ] Technology: Python 3.13+ and UV?
- [ ] Scope: Are we avoiding databases/web/auth (Phase I)?

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
